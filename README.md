The Python-Game project is a simple game built using the Python programming language. The game is a basic guessing game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range. The game features a user-friendly interface that allows the user to input their guess and receive feedback on whether their guess is too high or too low. The project is built using Python and utilizes basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and functions. This project can be useful for anyone who is learning Python and wants to practice their programming skills by building a simple game.
